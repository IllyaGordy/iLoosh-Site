            	<p>This will be my first blog post one of the site I am making from scratch to find a job in Berlin come summer 2014 as well as to represent what I am, hopefully this works out. So let me first lay out a few ideas about what I want to have on my site. I have gotten pretty good and making simple template based websites and making them work and look professional. The phrase professional here is really up to the eye of the viewer, but I have been told good things about it. So my first initially point is to show off what I have up to now, which includes some of the work I have done for the Canadian Centre for Clinical Trials, Q water, Pitka Koirat and TEDxRyersonU. Now the next point here is to show of some of my school projects that I have been working on, there are two part to it. One is setting up a well functioning GitHub account and the second part is to try to make all of my projects work up to 90% so any user can just go on take my code and run it. This will be an excellent opportunity to review all kind or code reusability knowledge that was given to me in the Software Engineering courses as well as over all project organization courses.</p>

                	<p>Now on to some actual work, first thing is I have to see where I have left my old website at. Well this is where it is now, beautiful I know! Although it looks simple it already has a few awesome features that will simplify everything for me. Number one an most important is that it is running, I have the domain in place, I have my hosting payed for and all of this put in ahead of many people who start off at the “.wordpress.com" sites. The second part of why I am a bit ahead is that I have CloudFlare account set-up on my website, which will always be fast and safer then so many other websites.</p>

              </div>
              
             
              <p>The next set-up is to put CloudFlare in to developer mode and start with the blog page. I have an old site I have set-up with the “travel” subdomain, I am thinking I will remove this for now by modifying the “robots.txt” file so search engines do not see it.</p>
              <p>Now the next set-up is to get the blog up, for now I will do redundant work that I will fix later. I will download and set-up the newest Bootstrap framework and make a very basic website with just an intro page, blog and contact me.</p>
              <p>So I have downloaded the basic bootstrap files, went over to the Getting Started page and took the code from the Starter Template. After some modification the page looks like this. Time to change a few other things like the menu names and adding in the footer for a disclaimer, as well as a very simple into. All of this will be change later on.</p>
              <p>Now its time to create a blog page, that will contain all the individual blogs. Now since I am making this from scratch, my main goal is simplicity.</p>
